- **Automated Trading**: Integrates with Alpaca API for seamless trading operations including buying and selling stocks.
- **Risk Management**: Calculates position sizes based on available cash and predefined risk tolerance.
- **Daily Iterations**: Runs trading logic in daily intervals, adjusting positions based on updated sentiment.
